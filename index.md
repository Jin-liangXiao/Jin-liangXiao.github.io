## About Me

I'm currently working toward [school of mathematics](https://maths.swjtu.edu.cn/), [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/).

Before that, I got my Ph.D. degree (advised by [Prof. Ting-Zhu Huang](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/2041.htm) and [Prof. Liang-Jian Deng](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/)) in mathematics with the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China. I received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from the [Yunnan University](https://www.ynu.edu.cn), Kunming, Yunnan, China.
In 2016 and 2017, I was a Joint-Training B.S. student in [School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/).

From Nov. 2023 to Oct. 2024, I was an intern with the Tensor Learning Team, [RIKEN AIP](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/), Tokyo, Japan, under the supervision of [Prof. Qibin Zhao](https://qibinzhao.github.io/).
 
My research interest is mainly focusing on **image fusion**, **Tensor Learning**, **Deep Learning**.
