## About Me

I'm currently working toward the Ph.D. degree (advised by [Prof. Ting-Zhu Huang](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/2041.htm) and [Prof. Liang-Jian Deng](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/)) in mathematics with the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

Before that, I received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics from the [Yunnan University](www.ynu.uestc.edu.cn), Kunming, Yunnan, China.

 

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, and **image generation**.
